# TASK-041 — carry-forward obligations

T41 delivers config, names and helpers that nothing consumes yet. REV-059 M-1 pointed out that the
promises behind them were written nowhere the later tasks will read. They are written here instead of
in `05_development_tasks.md`, because editing that file moves the PLAN baseline and strands every
record bound to it. Each item names the task that must discharge it and where it came from.

| Task | Obligation | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T42 | Require `import.root` when the import services register; today it is optional so import-less deployments boot | HD-039 (B) |
| T42 | Create the root and `source`/`result` as mode 0700, owned by the service user; refuse a root writable by group or other (for example `/tmp`) | REV-059 L-7, L-6 |
| T42 | At storage start, `realpath` and `lstat` each configured root (Customer import and attachment, Item media and import — HD-040); refuse when two share `dev`+`ino` or one real path contains another. The startup check compares strings only, so case-insensitive filesystems and symlinked parents pass it | REV-059 L-5 |
| T42 | The precheck and worker services declare `static jobs` with `SUPPLIER_IMPORT_JOB_NAMES.precheck` and `.worker`, and a test deep-equals them. The scheduler silently ignores an override for a job name nothing registers | REV-059 M-1 |
| T42 | Every stored file name comes from `newSupplierImportStoredName()` and every path from `supplierImportFilePath()` | REV-059 M-1 |
| T43 | Reassess DEF-023 before CSV import accepts account-like columns: request-log redaction is a field-name blacklist, and a 5xx captures the full body | HD-036 §3, DEF-023 |
| T43 | The CSV `split` test is a tripwire, not proof: it misses `split(",", n)`, a separator held in a variable, `split("\r")` and `fromCharCode(44)`. T43's review must confirm every CSV read and write goes through `csv-parse` / `csv-stringify` | REV-060 L-11 |
| T44 / T45 | A result or source download takes the stored name from the job row, never from the request | REV-059 I-6 |
| T44 / T45 | Before serving a stored file, `lstat` it and refuse `nlink > 1`: a hard link planted in the root would serve content from outside it | REV-059 I-6, REV-060 I-12 |
| T48 | The purge service declares `SUPPLIER_IMPORT_JOB_NAMES.purge` | REV-059 M-1 |
| T48 | Immediately before each `unlink`: `lstat` the kind directory and require the same `dev`+`ino` as at listing; `lstat` the file and require `isFile()` and the same `dev`, and `nlink === 1`; unlink the bare stored name joined to that verified directory. A failed delete is logged and retried next run (design §12.4) | REV-059 L-6 |

## Mutation record for TASK-041

Round 1 (commit 805423e), against `supplierImportConfig`, `supplierConfig` and `configuration` tests —
all killed: relative root accepted; root not normalised; overlap check not called; prefix match instead
of containment; one direction only; symlinked files listed; `stat` instead of `lstat`; any stored name;
any kind; a naive split added; two job names colliding.

Round 2 (after REV-059) — all killed: the `dev` check removed (now testable through an injected
`lstat`); the three attachment roots ignored; the `$` anchor removed; the listing root not resolved;
a filesystem root accepted; `split(",")` planted in `handlers/supplier-approvals`; the same planted in a
not-yet-created `handlers/supplier-imports`; `split(/,/)` and `split("\n")` planted in
`modules/supplier`. Round 1 was re-run after the test changes and stayed all-killed.

## Status after TASK-042

| Obligation | Status |
| --- | --- |
| 0700 root and kind directories, owned by the service user; group/other-writable root refused | **Done** — `prepareSupplierImportRoot`, run by `SupplierImportWorkerService.initialize` |
| `realpath` + `dev`/`ino` overlap check against Customer and Item roots | **Done** — same function; `fs.promises.realpath` restores on-disk case, so a case variant on a case-insensitive filesystem is caught |
| Worker `static jobs` use `SUPPLIER_IMPORT_JOB_NAMES.worker`, pinned by a test | **Done** |
| Stored names only via `newSupplierImportStoredName` / `supplierImportFilePath` | **Not yet exercised** — T42 writes no files; carried to T43 (upload) |
| Precheck job uses `SUPPLIER_IMPORT_JOB_NAMES.precheck` | **Moved to T43** — precheck is T43's job; T42 has nothing to schedule for it |
| Root required when import services register (HD-039 B) | **Moved to T43/T44 by HD-046 (a)** — required when the upload API registers, which is when import is actually deployed. The T42 worker registers everywhere and does nothing without a root; with no upload there are no jobs |

New obligations T42 creates:

| Task | Obligation |
| --- | --- |
| T43 / T44 | Refuse startup without `import.root` once the upload API registers (HD-046 a) |
| T45 | Wire the real `applyRow` into `SupplierImportWorkerService` (it claims nothing until then), writing Supplier and audit on the given connection and returning the Supplier ID |
| T45 | Re-check at execution that the confirming user is still active and holds `supplier.mgmt`, as Customer import does; T42 does not |

## Mutation record for TASK-042

All killed, against `supplierImportService`, `supplierImportWorkerService` and the
`supplierImportExecution` integration test on real MySQL: claiming a running job whose lease is live;
newest job first; invalid rows not skipped; rows out of order; lease not checked; the applied marker
committed in a separate transaction; an `applyRow` that returns no ID accepted; the thrown message stored
as the row error; finalize with rows pending; finalize ignoring failures; a terminal state reopened; the
worker ignoring abort; the worker running without `applyRow`; the root not prepared; a loose root
accepted; the realpath overlap skipped; the rows CHECK not inspected; a CASCADE row FK accepted; the job
column types not inspected. Four of these first survived and each got a test.
